# Emotion_Capture_using_DeepFace_with_smart_response
This Git repository contains a Python application for real-time emotion detection using computer vision and deep learning. The application is built using several libraries and technologies, including OpenCV, DeepFace, pyjokes, randomization, pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech output), and Streamlit for the user interface.
